*Our Goals for the Robot*
 
- The goal of our robot is to fully leverage UIPATH Studio to interact with a browser based gmail inbox to download all pdf attachments.
- We plan to provide the user with the total nunmber of attachments downloaded.
- Each pdf will be obtained through Google Chrome gMail web client and deposited into a folder on the local machine.

## Why is it Important? 
It can be tedious and/or difficult to download all pdf attachments from a set of emails.
