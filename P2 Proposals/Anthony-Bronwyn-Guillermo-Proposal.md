# Weather Lookout.

### Authors: Anthony Hernandez, Bronwyn Davies, Guillermo Ventura-Reyes.

## Problem
Marking events in your calendar is useful for keeping track of important events in your life. There are multiple factors that can impact these events. One important factor that may impact these events is weather. Bad weather that sneaks up on you can either ruin or hamper a planned event. While you can check the weather manually yourself, an advantage to RPA is that this can be done for you in order to notify you about weather that can impact your plans. 

## Solution
Our Automation project would circle around monitoring local weather for a user up to 5 days in advance, due to the accuracy rate of weather for a 5-day forecast being 75%. By checking the weather for your zipcode and checking your google calendar for up 5 days in advanced, this RPA notification system will e-mail you about possible conflicts with your schedule, alongside e-mailing you updates on the weather forecast. If there is a conflict you care about, you can choose to return a response indicating a day to reschedule your event.
