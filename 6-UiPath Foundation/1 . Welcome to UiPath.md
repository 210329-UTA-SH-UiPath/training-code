Automation is here! Rapidly redefining workplaces and jobs around the world. It is creating unique opportunities for all students across the globe. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is one such technology which is helping knowledge workers getting rid of mundane, repetitive, boring tasks by letting the software robot do it for them and them becoming more creative. **Revature** is pioneering RPA education for you in collaboration with [UiPath](http://www.uipath.com/), world’s leading Robotic Process Automation (RPA) company. I encourage you to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity and learn how to automate processes and build your own robots.

As a student: once you learn process automation and build your own software robot assistant, the robot can help you in ways that are restricted only by your imagination and creativity. As a start, you can build robots who can help you do research more easily by going through scores of websites, research papers, publications or search for financial aid opportunity, find deals on items you want to buy, help you prepare for the class…. the list is unlimited! Some of you could even think of ways to initiate your own start-up!
